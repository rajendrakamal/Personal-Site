# Portfolio

Responsive single-page portfolio website featuring:

- Sticky header with animated hamburger navigation for mobile

- Intersection Observer powered reveal animations and progress indicators
- Accessible, keyboard-friendly interactions and smooth scrolling

## Getting started

Open `HTML-personalsite/index.html` in your browser or run a local web server:

```bash
cd HTML-personalsite
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000>.

Update the placeholder content (name, bio, links, experience, etc.) inside `index.html` to personalize the site. Styling lives in `css/styles.css`, and interactivity is handled in `js/main.js`.
